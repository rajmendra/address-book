# 📒 Address Book

A modern, type-safe address book built using **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **SQLite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This app fetches user data from [https://dummyjson.com/users](https://dummyjson.com/users), seeds the database on first run (or every hour), and provides interactive filtering, sorting, and search functionality.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Fetches and persists user data from DummyJSON API using Prisma + SQLite
* ✅ Fully responsive, accessible UI built with Tailwind CSS
* ✅ Powerful filters: search by name/email, filter by gender, and sort by name or age
* ✅ Data seeded and cached for one hour to reduce API load
* ✅ Type-safe validation with Zod
* ✅ Clean project structure with separation of concerns
* ✅ Pagination support (client-side or server-side ready)
* ✅ Uses `next/font` for optimized custom fonts (Geist)
